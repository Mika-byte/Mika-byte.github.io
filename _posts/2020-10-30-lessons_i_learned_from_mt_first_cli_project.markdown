The cold truth is, when it comes to learning to code you have to be prepared to feel inadequate on a regular basis. You can’t really control all outcomes of your codes. You have to be prepared to investigate why something broke and why it is finally working for you.

Learning to code is a road dotted with excitement, the smell of something new always lingering in the air. 
The first time I saw someone else’s CLI project, their overwhelming explanation of scrapping, gems, and HTTP Party felt like they were part of this exclusive sorcerers’ club that I will probably never gain admittance. 

Since I already felt quite inadequate, the only way to go is only up. The way to the top is paved with frustrations, long nights of wondering, obsessing about new concepts, and confusions. It is still a long way up there but there is relief knowing I will get there one line of code at a time. 

Google and I have become quite excellent pals. Panic and I broke up. It’s already daunting to learn something new, there is no need to hinder the process with a sense of fear.
# Lessons learn
•	I learn by repeating the same task over and over helps me. I practically left self-consciousness at the door whenever I get ready to learn something new, be it a foreign language, a new skill, or programming. Unlike a foreign language when one can easily read a book or watch a video to gain some understanding, coding requires hands-on. No amount of online tutorials can compensate for practice. 

•	I learn that going to sleep to be able to code another day is very important for my brain to process and make sense of new concepts.

•	Talk it out. I learn that talking about what I am trying to do to myself out loud or someone else helps me retain and gain clarity.
